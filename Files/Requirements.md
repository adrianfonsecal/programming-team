## Survey and survey analysis

In search of the problem of misinformation of our partners, we decided to make a survey to validate our suspicions. And based on the [results obtained](Graphics.md), we carried out the documentation of the project.


<a name="Item1"></a>

## Main objective 

Build a software system capable of reducing the lack of information for the new students of the UADY´s Mathematics Faculty.

<a name="Item2"></a>

## User Profile 

Students of the UADY´s Mathematics Faculty. with an average of 18-22 years old who study any of the first 3 semesters, which presents difficulties obtaining information related to the faculty.

<a name="Item3"></a>

## Scope and limitations of the project 

### Scope 

1. The users will be the UADY´s Mathematics Faculty students, focusing on the students who are studying the first three semesters in the faculty.
   
2. The main media outlet will be the faculty’s student council.
   
### Limitations 

1. The system will not register nor enroll in courses or scholarships.
   
2. The system will not work as a means of communication with the faculty authorities.
